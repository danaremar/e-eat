Use core `nav_menu_link_attributes` and `nav_menu_item_title` filters.

= How to wrap menu link text in `span` html element =

Menu link text is already wrapped in `span.menu-image-title`.

To add a new size (or remove an old one) add a function to the `menu_image_default_sizes` filter. For example

`
<?php
add_filter( 'menu_image_default_sizes', function($sizes) {

  // remove the default 36x36 size
  unset($sizes['menu-36x36']);

  // add a new size
  $sizes['menu-50x50'] = array(50,50);

  // return $sizes (required)
  return $sizes;

});
?>
`

= How to make hovered image visible on current page of menu item? =

Add this link to style.css
`
.menu-item.current-menu-item > a.menu-image-hovered img.hovered-image {
  opacity: 1;
}
`

If you srcset property look like this:
`<img width="36" height="36" src="http://static.mywebsite.com/website/myaction_express_menu_icon-36x36.png" class="attachment-menu-36x36 size-menu-36x36" alt="myaction_express_menu_icon" srcset="http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/D:homesitewwwroot/wp-content/uploads/myaction_express_menu_icon-50x50.png 50w, http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/D:homesitewwwroot/wp-content/uploads/myaction_express_menu_icon-75x75.png 75w, http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/D:homesitewwwroot/wp-content/uploads/myaction_express_menu_icon-24x24.png 24w, http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/D:homesitewwwroot/wp-content/uploads/myaction_express_menu_icon-36x36.png 36w, http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/D:homesitewwwroot/wp-content/uploads/myaction_express_menu_icon-48x48.png 48w, http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/D:homesitewwwroot/wp-content/uploads/myaction_express_menu_icon.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 36px) 100vw, 36px">`
