Yes, this plugin is completely dependant on WooCommerce. Please setup your store/restaurant using WooCommerce, then you can use this plugin to make it an online food ordering hub.

= Where would I add my food items? =
Food items will be added as WooCommerce product only. When used with ShortCode those products will be shown as delicious food items on your Restaurant Menu page.

= Will it show the UI correctly with my current theme? =
We have used minimal hard coded css to make it compatible with all kinds of theme. As there are hundreds of theme available out there the output might not be same for all of them. But plugin does have a customizer where you can add your css to adjust the little up and downs. Any this customization won't be affected by future version updates.
