= HAVE DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES =

You can assign different capability module for each membership level.

You may create totally different capability group with all flexibilities (example: product limit, categories, product types etc) for each membership level.

But this is not directly part of this add-on, Capability modules are come from [WCFM - Groups & Staffs](http://wclovers.com/product/woocommerce-frontend-manager-groups-staffs/).

They may also change their subscription plan any time - upgrade or downgrade.

= Pay for Product Option =

This will allow you to setup a system where vendor has to pay before adding a product -

= Feedback = 

All we want is love. We are extremely responsive about support requests - so if you face a problem or find any bugs, shoot us a mail or post it in the support forum, and we will respond within 6-12 hours(during business days). If you get the impulse to rate the plugin low because it is not working as it should, please do wait for our response because the root cause of the problem may be something else. 

It is extremely disheartening when trigger happy users downrate a plugin for no fault of the plugin. 

Feel free to reach us either via our [support forum](https://wclovers.com/forums) or [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wc-multivendor-membership), happy to serve anything you looking for. 

Really proud to serve and enhance [WooCommerce](http://woocommerce.com).

Be with us ... Team [WC Lovers](https://wclovers.com)

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.7 or greater
* WooCommerce 3.0 or greater
* PHP version 5.6 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce Frontend Manager, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "WooCommerce Multivendor Membership" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our eCommerce plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
